<section id="bio">
    <h2>Early Life & Background</h2>
    <p>Lee Jin-wook was born in Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, as the youngest son of a civil servant father. His family lived modestly, and he was a very quiet, observant, and thoughtful child who never participated in school talent shows. Everyone was surprised when he chose acting, given his reserved personality.</p>
    <p>He enrolled in Environmental Engineering at Cheongju University but dropped out at age 21 to pursue his dream in Seoul. Despite family opposition, he moved to the capital, lived with his sister or friends, and worked part-time jobs (construction sites, cafes) to support himself. He saved money to attend acting classes, created his own portfolio, and distributed it to agencies and magazines. In 2003 he debuted as a print model in a Panasonic commercial and quickly landed 9 commercials within one year.</p>
    <p>He belongs to the Jeongju Lee clan and is a descendant of King Sejong the Great through Prince Milseong (12th son). He often jokes about having “royal blood” and says it gives him a sense of elegance and responsibility in acting roles (e.g., in The Three Musketeers).</p>
